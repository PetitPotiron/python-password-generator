# Python Password Generator
__/!\\__ The project is written in french !


A simple password generator written in python with the tkinter library. The idea of this project was given to me by [Graven](https://www.youtube.com/user/Gravenilvectuto) on [a video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/N4M4W7JPOL4). I've improve the main idea, with a system to register the password in a file `password.txt` and another to copy it to the clipboard. There are also alerts if you want to copy the password, but there is no password, for example.
